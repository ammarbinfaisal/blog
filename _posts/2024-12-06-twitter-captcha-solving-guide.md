title: "Cracking Twitterâ€™s CAPTCHA: A Guide"
---

I recently got a client on upwork who wanted me to automate twitter signup process especially the part of solving the funcaptcha, and boy, do I have some stories to share. 

---

After countless hours of debugging, several facepalm moments, and way too much coffee, I finally got it working reliably. Here's everything I learned about handling Twitter's CAPTCHAs - hopefully it'll save you some headaches!

## The Initial Struggle

When I first started this project, I thought, "How hard can it be? Just send the CAPTCHA to a solving service and we're done, right?" Oh, how naive I was. Turns out, Twitter's implementation using Arkose Labs' FunCaptcha is pretty sophisticated. The first few attempts failed miserably because I was missing crucial pieces of the puzzle.

## The Breakthrough: Token Extraction

After a lot of trial and error (and packet sniffing), I discovered that we need three critical pieces:
- The data blob
- Session token
- Flow token

Here's the code that finally worked for capturing the data blob:

```python
if 'arkoselabs.com' in url:
    if 'data=' in url:
        parsed = urlparse(url)
        params = parse_qs(parsed.query)
        if 'data' in params:
            self.data_blob = unquote(params['data'][0])
```

Fun fact: I initially tried getting the data blob from the page source, which worked... until it didn't. The URL parameter method above proved much more reliable.

## The Session Token Saga

Getting the session token was its own adventure. Here's what finally worked:

```python
if '/rtig/image' in url:
    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    params = parse_qs(parsed_url.query)
    
    if 'sessionToken' in params:
        self.session_token = params['sessionToken'][0]
```

## The CAPTCHA Solving Dance

Here's where things get interesting. After trying various services, I found that using multiple solvers with fallback is the way to go. Here's my battle-tested approach:

```python
async def solve_captcha(self):
    # Try 2captcha first
    token = await self.solve_with_2captcha()
    if not token:
        # Fallback to anti-captcha
        token = await self.solve_with_anticaptcha()
```

## The Token Submission Nightmare

This part had me pulling my hair out. Just getting the token isn't enough - you need to submit it correctly. After many failed attempts, here's what actually works:

{% raw %}
```python
await frame.evaluate(f"""
    const message = {{
        eventId: "challenge-complete",
        payload: {{
            sessionToken: "{token}"
        }}
    }};
    
    // Try multiple targets because why not?
    [window.parent, window.top, window].forEach(target => {{
        try {{
            target.postMessage(JSON.stringify(message), "*");
        }} catch (e) {{
            console.error('PostMessage failed:', e);
        }}
    }});
""")
```
{% endraw %}

## Things I Wish I Knew Earlier

1. **Don't Rush the Submit**
   ```python
   await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Give it a moment to breathe
   ```
   I kept getting failures because I was submitting the token too quickly. Adding a small delay fixed it.

2. **Check Your Frames**
   Always make sure the frame exists before trying to submit:
   ```python
   if not arkose_frames:
       print("No frames found - time to panic!")
       return False
   ```


## My Biggest Facepalm Moments

Spent hours debugging and figuring out how to submit the funcaptcha solution.

## Final Thoughts

Getting Twitter's CAPTCHA system working reliably is definitely possible, but it requires attention to detail and a lot of patience. The key things to remember:
- Use multiple solving services
- Handle your frames carefully
- Log everything (you'll thank me later)
