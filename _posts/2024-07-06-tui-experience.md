## My Journey with Terminal User Interfaces: From Todo App to Vim Clone

![ri demo](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQFIsyXF5MIRzw/feedshare-shrink_1280/0/1720215856416?e=1724284800&v=beta&t=-lwyybHbJlgMJkxPwKg8nQ0al9AXVnUMg1OJiNDKmhY)

It was 2019 when I first dipped my toes into the world of terminal user interfaces. Digging through my old projects recently, I stumbled upon "Taskss" - a todo CLI app I had built using Node.js. Back then, I was determined to grasp the fundamentals, so I challenged myself to create everything from scratch, shunning external libraries for the TUI.

Taskss was simple, but it represented my first foray into crafting user experiences within the constraints of a terminal. Little did I know that this modest beginning would set me on a path of fascination with terminal interfaces.

Fast forward to 2024, and I find myself putting the finishing touches on a project that would have seemed impossibly complex to my 2019 self - a Vim clone built in Rust which I call "[ri](https://github.com/ammarbinfaisal/ri)."

The journey from [Taskss](https://github.com/ammarbinfaisal/taskss) to this Vim clone mirrors my growth as a developer. This Vim clone isn't just a project; it's a testament to countless hours of tinkering, troubleshooting, and those eureka moments when complex problems finally clicked.
